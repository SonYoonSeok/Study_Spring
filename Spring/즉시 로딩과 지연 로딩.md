# 즉시 로딩과 지연 로딩

* JPA에서 연관관계를 설정해 줄 때 설정해주는 옵션으로 `@OneToMany`은  `FetchType.LAZY`를 기본값으로 가가지고 `@ManyToOne`은 `FetchType.EAGER`를 기본값으로 지닌다.



## FetchType.EAGER

```java
public class Member extends BaseEntity {
    /*
    	중략..
    */ 
    @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.EAGER)
    @JoinColumn(name = "team_id", insertable = false, updatable = false)
    private Team team;
}
```

* 다대일 관계로 Team과 연결되어 있는 Member 엔티티이다.



```sql
System.out.println(findMember.getTeam().getClass());

Hibernate: 
    select
        member0_.id as id1_4_0_,
        member0_.createdBy as createdB2_4_0_,
        member0_.createdDate as createdD3_4_0_,
        member0_.lastModifiedBy as lastModi4_4_0_,
        member0_.lastModifiedDate as lastModi5_4_0_,
        member0_.age as age6_4_0_,
        member0_.description as descript7_4_0_,
        member0_.locker_id as locker_10_4_0_,
        member0_.roleType as roleType8_4_0_,
        member0_.team_id as team_id11_4_0_,
        member0_.name as name9_4_0_,
        locker1_.id as id1_3_1_,
        locker1_.name as name2_3_1_,
        team2_.id as id1_8_2_,
        team2_.createdBy as createdB2_8_2_,
        team2_.createdDate as createdD3_8_2_,
        team2_.lastModifiedBy as lastModi4_8_2_,
        team2_.lastModifiedDate as lastModi5_8_2_,
        team2_.name as name6_8_2_ 
    from
        Member member0_ 
    left outer join
        Locker locker1_ 
            on member0_.locker_id=locker1_.id 
    left outer join
        Team team2_ 
            on member0_.team_id=team2_.id 
    where
        member0_.id=?
```

* 멤버 내에 있는 칼럼인 Team과 Class만 받아오면 되지만 연관관계가 설정된 모든 테이블을 `left outer join`하여 받아온다.
* 즉시 로딩을 사용한다면 훨씬 많은 연관관계를 가지고 있는 실무에서는 필요없는 테이블까지 모두 다 join되어 버려 성능에서 큰 차이가 날 수 있다.



## FetchType.LAZY

```java
public class Member extends BaseEntity {
    /*
    	중략..
    */ 
    @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
    @JoinColumn(name = "team_id", insertable = false, updatable = false)
    private Team team;
}
```

```sql
System.out.println(findMember.getTeam().getClass());
System.out.println("TEAM NAME : " + findMember.getTeam().getName());

Hibernate: 
    select
        member0_.id as id1_4_0_,
        member0_.createdBy as createdB2_4_0_,
        member0_.createdDate as createdD3_4_0_,
        member0_.lastModifiedBy as lastModi4_4_0_,
        member0_.lastModifiedDate as lastModi5_4_0_,
        member0_.age as age6_4_0_,
        member0_.description as descript7_4_0_,
        member0_.locker_id as locker_10_4_0_,
        member0_.roleType as roleType8_4_0_,
        member0_.team_id as team_id11_4_0_,
        member0_.name as name9_4_0_,
        locker1_.id as id1_3_1_,
        locker1_.name as name2_3_1_ 
    from
        Member member0_ 
    left outer join
        Locker locker1_ 
            on member0_.locker_id=locker1_.id 
    where
        member0_.id=?
        
class hello.jpa.Team$HibernateProxy$z4JtUeLD  // 프록시 객체

Hibernate: 
    select
        team0_.id as id1_8_0_,
        team0_.createdBy as createdB2_8_0_,
        team0_.createdDate as createdD3_8_0_,
        team0_.lastModifiedBy as lastModi4_8_0_,
        team0_.lastModifiedDate as lastModi5_8_0_,
        team0_.name as name6_8_0_ 
    from
        Team team0_ 
    where
        team0_.id=?
```

* 모든 엔티티를 바로 불러오는것이 아닌 프록시 객체로 저장된 Team 엔티티를 getTeam().getXXX()로  Team의 필드에 접근할 때 쿼리가 생성된다.
